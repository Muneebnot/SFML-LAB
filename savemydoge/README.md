# 🐶 Save My Doge from the Cats 🐱

A simple dodge-style game built with **C++** and **SFML** as a learning project.  
Control Doge to avoid getting hit by cats flying across the screen.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Move Doge up and down with your mouse.  
- Cats spawn randomly from the right side and move left.  
- Avoid the cats — each hit reduces Doge’s HP.  
- The game ends when Doge’s HP reaches 0.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 or later)  
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library installed and linked

## 🛠️ How it is Made
This project was built using **C++ and SFML**.  
Key features:
- **Sprites and Textures** for Doge and Cats.  
- **Random Spawning**: Cats appear at random vertical positions.  
- **Collision Detection**: Doge loses HP on collision with a cat.  
- **Health System**: Visual HP bar tracks Doge’s health.  
- **Screen Boundaries**: Doge can’t go outside the game window.
