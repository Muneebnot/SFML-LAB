# SFML-LAB 🎮

This repository contains all my **SFML learning projects**.  
Each folder inside this repo corresponds to a separate game or experiment I create while learning SFML in C++.

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is for **learning and experimentation** with SFML.  
- New projects will be added here as I practice more concepts, like:
  - Drawing shapes
  - Keyboard and mouse input
  - Collision detection
  - Using vectors and dynamic objects
  - Sound, textures, and more advanced SFML features
